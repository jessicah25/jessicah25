About Me
===========
I am a PhD student advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/">Jeffrey Bigham</a> and <a href="https://841.io">Fernando Diaz</a> in the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests are in dialog systems and personalized evaluation. I am interested in the way people communicate, as well as the intricacies that come with each person's communication style and preferences.
